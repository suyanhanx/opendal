title: Generate release note
---

This document describes how to generate release notes using GitHub:

1. Go to https://github.com/apache/opendal/releases/new to start a new release.
2. Fill the tag with `draft`.
3. Click on `Generate release notes` to generate them.
4. Copy the generated content and close the page.

Please note that we only use this feature to generate release notes, so please do not click on `Publish Release` or `Save draft`. We will publish it after creating the tag.
