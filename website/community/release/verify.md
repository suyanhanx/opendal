To verify a release candidate, the following checklist could be used:

- [ ] Download links are valid.
- [ ] Checksums and signatures.
- [ ] LICENSE/NOTICE files exist.
- [ ] No unexpected binary files.
- [ ] All source files have ASF headers.
- [ ] Can compile from source.

:::note

It is NOT necessary to run all checks to cast a vote for a release candidate.

However, you should clearly state which checks you did. The release manager needs to ensure that each check was done.

:::

## Download links are valid

To verify the release candidate, you need to download the release candidate from the [dist](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/opendal/) directory.

Our current distribution contains many files, which we recommend downloading using svn.

Use the following command to download all artifacts, replace "${release_version}-${rc_version}" with the version ID of the version to be released:

```shell
svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/opendal/${release_version}-${rc_version}/
```

## Checksums and signatures

Every file in a release candidate should have a checksum and signature file.

For example, if the release candidate is `0.46.0-rc1`, the checksum and signature file should be like:

```
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/opendal/0.46.0-rc1/apache-opendal-core-0.46.0-rc1-src.tar.gz.sha512
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/opendal/0.46.0-rc1/apache-opendal-core-0.46.0-rc1-src.tar.gz.asc
```

### Verify checksums and signatures

GnuPG is recommended here. It can be installed with the following command:

```shell
apt-get install gnupg
# or
yum install gnupg
# or
brew install gnupg
```

Firstly, import the OpenDAL release manager's public key:

```shell
curl https://downloads.apache.org/opendal/KEYS > KEYS # Download KEYS
gpg --import KEYS # Import KEYS to local
```

Then, trust the public key:

```shell
gpg --edit-key <KEY-used-in-this-version> # Edit the key
```

It will enter the interactive mode, use the following command to trust the key:

```shell
gpg> trust
```

And then, select the level of trust, for example:

```
Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
(by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

  1 = I don't know or won't say
  2 = I do NOT trust
  3 = I trust marginally
  4 = I trust fully
  5 = I trust ultimately
  m = back to the main menu
```

Select `5` to trust the key ultimately.

Now, we could start the verification.

We've provided a script to verify the checksum and signature of the release candidate.

The script is in the `scripts` directory of our repository.
You can download it directly from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/opendal/main/scripts/verify.py).
Please put it in the same directory as the release candidate.

Run the script in a specific release candidate's folder:

```shell
python ./verify.py
```

You will see the following output if the verification is successful:

```shell
$ python ./verify.py

## Check the file content of the source package

Unzip `apache-opendal-${release_version}-${rc_version}-src.tar.gz` and check the follows:

- LICENSE and NOTICE files are correct for the repository.
- All files have ASF license headers if necessary.
- Building is OK.

## Check the Maven artifacts of opendal-java

Download the artifacts from `https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapacheopendal-${maven_artifact_number}/`.

You can check the follows:

- Checksum of JARs matches the bundled checksum file.
- Signature of JARs matches the bundled signature file.
- JARs are reproducible locally. This means you can build the JARs on your machine and verify the checksum is the same with the bundled one.

The reproducibility requires the same JDK distribution and the same Maven distribution. You should use [Eclipse Temurin JDK 8](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=8) and the bundled Maven Wrapper to make the same artifacts.
